    <summary>SFML provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications. 
      It is composed of five modules: system, window, graphics, audio and network.

    <description>With SFML, your application can compile and run out of the box on the most common operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and soon Android and iOS.
      SFML has official bindings for the C and .Net languages. And thanks to its active community, it is also available in many other languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, Go, and more.
